# Case Study: AI Consulting Service Catalog

**Date:** January 2026
**Project:** Service Catalog & Pricing Framework
**Business Unit:** Softworks (Products)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Codified Softworks' pricing philosophy into a structured service catalog. Three-tier pricing (Foundation/Professional/Executive) aligned with PHILOSOPHY.md principles: sell outcomes not hours, diagnostic first, value-based at 7-12% of year-1 savings.

Key differentiator: **Training Assistant** included in Professional and Executive tiers—a custom chatbot that provides 24/7 client support without scaling Softworks' time.

## The Problem

### Requirements
- Standardized pricing for AI consulting engagements
- Value-based pricing when savings are quantifiable
- Partnership rate option for strategic relationships
- Detect project buildup/scope creep during intake
- Cross-functional across all client types
- Align with existing PHILOSOPHY.md principles

### Challenge
- No documented pricing structure
- Each engagement priced ad-hoc
- Inconsistent margin validation
- No framework for detecting when projects grow beyond initial scope

## Solution

### Three-Tier Structure

| Tier | Name | Fee | Position |
|------|------|-----|----------|
| A | Foundation | $2,000 | Entry (makes B look better) |
| B | Professional | $7,500 | **Target** (70-80% choose this) |
| C | Executive | $18,000 | Anchor (captures ongoing access seekers) |

### Value-Based Formula

```
annual_value = hours_saved_per_week × hourly_rate × 52
our_fee = annual_value × 0.07 to 0.12
```

**Example:**
- Client saves 18 hrs/week at $150/hr = $140,400/year value
- Fee at 10% = $14,040 (captures ~1 month of savings)
- ROI for client = 10x in year one

### Training Assistant (The Differentiator)

Included in Professional and Executive:
- Custom chatbot trained on client's specific workflows
- Step-by-step guides for every automated task
- Troubleshooting decision trees
- FAQ from onboarding questions
- Available 24/7

**Why it matters:** Client gets always-on support. Softworks scales without scaling time.

### Entry Point: Diagnostic First

**AI Opportunity Assessment** ($1,500-$3,000):
- 2-hour discovery session
- Document workflows and pain points
- Identify 3-5 opportunities with ROI projections
- Written report with recommendations

*"Never scope big projects blind."* — 70-80% of diagnostics convert to implementation.

### Partnership Rate

For strategic relationships:
- Show full market value
- Make discount visible, not hidden
- Example: $8,599 market value → $1,150 partnership rate (87% invested)

## Key Insights

### What Worked
- **Three options always**: Never present single price; middle option is target
- **Value conversation before price**: "What's the cost of NOT solving this?"
- **Training Assistant as differentiator**: Scales support without scaling time
- **Honest assessment**: "Build if... Skip if..." for each module

### What We Learned
- **Partnership rate builds relationships**: Strategic discount now → retainer later
- **Margin validation essential**: Track Softworks investment hours to ensure 40%+ margin
- **Modular pricing reduces friction**: Client picks what they want (like Iroko model)

### Patterns from PHILOSOPHY.md Applied
1. "Sell outcomes, not hours"
2. "Diagnostic first — never scope big projects blind"
3. "70-80% of buyers choose the middle option"
4. "Partnership rate: covers hard costs only, skill invested"
5. Green/red flag client selection framework

## Application: Matty Quote Framework

| Tier | Fee | Message |

**Lead with Professional** — it's the sweet spot.
