# PRICING PHILOSOPHY (FROM PHILOSOPHY.MD)
# =============================================================================

philosophy:
  core: "Sell outcomes, not hours."

  value_conversation:
    questions:
      - "What's the cost of NOT solving this in the next 12 months?"
      - "How would a 20% improvement look in dollars?"
      - "What have you already invested trying to solve this?"

    market_rate:
      description: |
        Full value pricing that accounts for:
        - Hard costs (subscriptions, APIs, domains, third-party tools)
        - Skill and judgment
        - Opportunity cost
        - Ongoing support

    partnership_rate:
      description: |
        Covers hard costs only. The skill is invested, not billed.

        When to apply:
        - Strategic relationships with long-term alignment
        - Portfolio-building projects that demonstrate capability
        - Mutual growth potential where success compounds

      transparency: |
        Always show full market value so clients understand what they're receiving.
        The discount is visible, not hidden.

      example: "Assured Integrity: $8,599 market value, $1,150 partnership rate (87% invested)"

  client_selection:
    green_flags:
      - "Ask 'what should we do?' not 'can you do this cheaper?'"
      - "Treat you as strategic advisor, not vendor"
      - "Value deliberate approach over rushed delivery"
      - "Have budget aligned with problem severity"
      - "Accessible decision-makers"

    red_flags:
      - "Price-first conversations before understanding scope"
      - "Scope creep without discussion"
      - "Transactional framing ('just need someone to execute')"
      - "Urgency without clear rationale"
      - "Decision-makers hidden behind gatekeepers"

    core_question: "Do they want strategic partnership or labor extraction?"

value_calculation:

  presentation: |
    "Based on our discovery, you're spending ~X hours/week on tasks we can automate.
    At your rate, that's $Y/year in time value.

    Our fee of $Z captures about N% of that—meaning you see [10-14]x return in year one.
    Plus, the Training Assistant and our support mean you're never stuck.

    By month N, the system pays for itself."

  when_to_use:
    - "Client has clear, quantifiable time savings"
    - "Client understands their hourly value"
    - "Savings are obvious and easy to project"

  recommendation: |
    Lead with Professional ($7,500) — sweet spot of value and accessibility.
    If he wants more, Executive ($15K) with capability transfer pitch.
    If budget-constrained, Foundation ($2K) keeps relationship alive.

  partnership_rate_consideration: |
    If Matty becomes a strong case study for "course creators using AI,"
    consider partnership rate on first engagement with retainer upsell.
    Show him the full market value so he understands what he's receiving.
