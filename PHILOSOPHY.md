# Softworks Trading Company — Operating Philosophy

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-26
**Applies To:** Softworks, Pitch Film Studios, PrePurchasePro, Tiwa

---

## Core Principle

**Sell outcomes, not hours.**

Top consultants who earn $20K+ monthly don't sell time — they sell transformation. The question isn't "what's my rate?" It's "what's the cost of NOT solving this problem?"

---

## Pricing Model

### Market Rate (Standard Clients)

Full value pricing that accounts for:
- Hard costs (subscriptions, APIs, domains, third-party tools)
- Skill and judgment
- Opportunity cost
- Ongoing support

Use the **value conversation framework**:
- "What's the cost of NOT solving this in the next 12 months?"
- "How would a 20% improvement look in dollars?"
- "What have you already invested trying to solve this?"

### Partnership Rate (Strategic Relationships)

Covers hard costs only. The skill is invested, not billed.

**When to apply:**
- Strategic relationships with long-term alignment
- Portfolio-building projects that demonstrate capability
- Mutual growth potential where success compounds

**Invoice transparency:** Always show full market value so clients understand what they're receiving. The discount is visible, not hidden.

**Example:** Assured Integrity invoice (2026-01) — $8,599 market value, $1,150 partnership rate (87% invested).

## Client Selection

### Green Flags

- Ask "what should we do?" not "can you do this cheaper?"
- Treat you as strategic advisor, not vendor
- Value deliberate approach over rushed delivery
- Have budget aligned with problem severity
- Accessible decision-makers

### Red Flags

- Price-first conversations before understanding scope
- Scope creep without discussion
- Transactional framing ("just need someone to execute")
- Urgency without clear rationale
- Decision-makers hidden behind gatekeepers

### Qualification Framework

**Core question:** Do they want strategic partnership or labor extraction?

Clients who perceive you as a trusted advisor give you 47% of their available business vs. 14% for transactional relationships. Optimize for the former.

**Mental cost justification:** Bad clients cost more than they pay — in revision cycles, scope disputes, and cognitive overhead. Selectivity is rational, not arrogant.

---

## Engagement Model

### Diagnostic First

Never scope big projects blind. Sell a paid diagnostic that positions you as the expert who already understands their business.

**AI Opportunity Assessment** ($1,500–$3,000):
- 2-hour discovery session
- Document current workflows and pain points
- Identify 3-5 opportunities with ROI projections
- Written report with prioritized recommendations
- 30-minute follow-up to discuss implementation

**Conversion rate:** 70-80% of diagnostics convert to implementation projects.

### Three-Option Proposals

70-80% of buyers choose the middle option. Never present a single price.

| Tier | Name | What's Included |
|------|------|-----------------|
| A | Foundation | Basic implementation, limited support window |
| B | Professional | Full implementation + training + documentation + 90-day support |
| C | Executive | Everything in B + strategic advisory + 6-month retainer |

**Target:** Option B. Option C exists to anchor value and capture clients who want ongoing access.

### Retainer Relationships

After successful project delivery, propose ongoing access:

**"Pay for Access" Model** ($3,000–$8,000/month):
- Monthly strategy call
- Unlimited async support (Slack/email)
- Priority response for technical questions
- Quarterly business review with new opportunity identification
- First call on new implementations

**Math:** 3 retainer clients at $5,000/month = $15,000 stable base. Add 1-2 projects per month = $20,000-$50,000 target.

---

## Delivery Philosophy

### Orchestrator Over Automator

An orchestrator works *with* tools. An automator manages dashboards.

**The distinction:**
- Orchestrators talk about workflows, models, judgment calls, touchpoints
- Automators talk about integrations, error rates, uptime

**Why it matters:** 70-85% of AI projects fail to reach production. 95% produce no measurable return. The failure isn't technology — it's automating before understanding.

### What to Automate

- Invoice formatting
- Transcription
- CRM updates
- Report generation
- Calendar management
- Data entry

### What to Orchestrate

- Client proposals
- Video concepts
- Strategic positioning
- Quality review
- Anything that affects how the business shows up in the world

**Principle:** Automate the mechanics. Orchestrate the meaning.

---

## Strategic Patience

### When to Wait

- The idea hasn't survived 6+ months of pressure testing
- You're moving from panic, not conviction
- Competitors haven't validated demand yet
- You'd need to guess at edge cases

### When to Move

- Conviction has compounded through conversations and research
- You understand the problem deeply enough to survive pivots
- Competitors have validated demand and surfaced objections
- You know which parts of your thesis are assumptions vs. knowledge

### Competitor Response

Competitors are validation, not threats.

When someone launches before you:
- They spent capital proving demand
- They surfaced objections
- They showed which features matter
- They built your roadmap for what to do differently

**Asymmetric advantage:** Free market research from someone else's stress and capital.

### Timeline Communication

Never promise speed. Promise outcomes.

"If two years kills your concept, you were never building a business. You were gambling on timing."

---

## Trust Infrastructure Thesis

### The Problem

For a decade, the internet let us pretend we could verify remotely at zero cost. Photos as proof. Descriptions as binding. Platform protections as safety nets.

AI dropped the friction of deception to zero. Now deception is easier than honesty. When that flips, trust collapses.

### The Response

Physical verification returns as rational response to synthetic media.

"We're not regressing. We're re-pricing risk accurately."

### Business Implications

- **PrePurchasePro:** Physical verification for high-value remote purchases
- **Softworks:** Human-in-the-loop AI delivery, not just AI output
- **Pitch Film Studios:** Authentic production vs. AI-generated content
- **General:** Premium services provide verified, human-witnessed truth in low-trust markets
